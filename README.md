run commands

npm run build
npm start

npm start will start an express server to test the SPA

To test an SPA with frontend routing enabled, index.html needs to be served, plus all requests need to be redirected to index.html (obviously, because the routed panes are on index.html, so browsing to another location to test the front end router without using the basic express server will just result in a 404.

# todo list
1) Update package.json scripts to be less bad.
   1) more generic copy/move/delete
   2) stage the builds in a temp dir instead of using src for staging
